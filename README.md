# üß† VOID üß†

I could never find an app that combined all my needs as a second-brain tool. And that's how the idea for this project was born!

## üîë Key differences from popular second-brain apps

* **üîÆ Rich functionality**: The application was conceived as a hybrid of Notion and Obsidian. I hope I can satisfy all your (and my)) needs!
* **üîê Local-first**: Your data is stored locally! No third-party servers! Your secrets remain yours!
* **‚öìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Open-source**: The code is fully open and available to everyone on GitHub!
* **‚ú® Cross-platform**: If your platform is not yet supported, you can simply rebuild it from source!
* **üõ†Ô∏è Easy to customize**: The functionality of the app can be easily configured and extended without any programming skills!
* **üí™ Flexible plugin system**: A wide range of pre-installed plugins, and if that‚Äôs not enough, you can easily create your own!
* **üöÄ Fast and efficient**: The app is built with Rust and focused on performance!

## üóêÔ∏è Roadmap

Still under development, I'll share plans soon.

## üìù Contact the Developer

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me on Telegram [@iomanip](https://t.me/GhostOfTranshumanist).

## üíµ Support the Project

You can support the project on [Boosty](https://boosty.to/void_project) and in the future on ~~[Patreon](...)~~

If this project can replace my job, I can devote more time to its development and release it faster.
Everyone who supports the project will be mentioned on the official site and in the "Sponsors" section of the app.
