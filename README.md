# 🧠 VOID 🧠

I could never find an app that combined all my needs as a second-brain tool. And that's how the idea for this project was born!

## 🔑 Key differences from popular second-brain apps

* **🔮 Rich functionality**: The application was conceived as a hybrid of Notion and Obsidian. I hope I can satisfy all your (and my)) needs!
* **🔐 Local-first**: Your data is stored locally! No third-party servers! Your secrets remain yours!
* **⚓️‍💥 Open-source**: The code is fully open and available to everyone on GitHub!
* **✨ Cross-platform**: If your platform is not yet supported, you can simply rebuild it from source!
* **🛠️ Easy to customize**: The functionality of the app can be easily configured and extended without any programming skills!
* **💪 Flexible plugin system**: A wide range of pre-installed plugins, and if that’s not enough, you can easily create your own!
* **🚀 Fast and efficient**: The app is built with Rust and focused on performance!
